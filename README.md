# Team Management Tree

# Company Directory Tree

This project implements a custom binary tree to model a company reporting structure. Each employee is represented as a node in the tree, with up to two direct reports stored as left and right child nodes.

The application allows users to add a team lead, insert employees under an existing manager, and print the current team structure using a command line interface.

## Features
- Custom EmployeeNode and TeamTree classes
- Recursive insertion to locate managers in the hierarchy
- Recursive tree printing with indentation to visualize structure
- Command line interface for interacting with the tree

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python tree_builder.py
